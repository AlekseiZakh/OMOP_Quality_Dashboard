📊 Quality Check Overview
1. Completeness Analysis

Critical Fields: person_id, concept_ids (must be 100% complete)
Demographics: Gender, birth year, race/ethnicity completeness
Clinical Data: Conditions, drugs, procedures completeness
Scoring: Weighted completeness score with configurable thresholds

2. Temporal Consistency

Future Dates: Clinical events with impossible future dates
Death Logic: Events occurring after patient death
Birth Consistency: Death dates after birth, realistic ages
Visit Duration: Negative durations, extremely long stays

3. Concept Mapping Quality

Unmapped Concepts: Records with concept_id = 0
Standard Usage: Percentage using standard vs non-standard concepts
Vocabulary Coverage: Distribution across SNOMED, ICD, RxNorm, etc.
Domain Integrity: Concepts used in appropriate tables

4. Referential Integrity
